## SECTION 3: PROBLEM AGITATION

**Section Title:**
```
The Real Cost of Professional Video Shoots (Hint: It's Not Just Money)
```

**Column Headers:**
```
Traditional Shoot
Our AI Service
```

**Comparison Items:**

**Cost:**
```
Traditional: $2,000 - $5,000
Description: Per single shoot

Our Service: $4.99
Description: For 5 videos
```

**Time:**
```
Traditional: 2-4 weeks
Description: To organize everything

Our Service: 5 minutes
Description: Until results ready
```

**Complexity:**
```
Traditional: Hire model, photographer, location
Description: Complex logistics

Our Service: 4 simple steps
Description: No complexity
```

**Results:**
```
Traditional: One result
Description: What if you don't like it?

Our Service: 5 videos to choose from
Description: Pick your favorite
```

**Availability:**
```
Traditional: Geographic limitations
Description: Not available everywhere

Our Service: Works from anywhere
Description: 24/7 access
```

**Emotional Appeal:**
```
You know video sells. But $2,000-$5,000 for a professional shoot? That's not realistic when you're bootstrapping or testing new products.

You're competing with 4+ million Etsy sellers. The ones winning have professional videos. You don't have the budget, and you can't risk thousands on something that might not work.

Now there's a better way.

## SECTION 7: FAQ

**Section Title:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

**Section Subtitle:**
```
Everything you need to know about creating AI videos for your clothing
```

**FAQ Items:**

**Q1:**
```
Question: Will this work for my handmade items?

Answer:
Yes, absolutely! Our technology works with any clothing — from vintage to avant-garde, from handmade to mass production. If it can be worn, we can create a video.

Moreover, handmade items especially benefit from video, as it allows you to showcase unique details and quality of craftsmanship in motion.
```

**Q2:**
```
Question: Doesn't this violate Etsy rules?

Answer:
No, it's completely legal. You own full rights to the generated content — it's your marketing material.

It's like using stock photos or graphic design, only much better and more personalized. Etsy allows the use of marketing materials to present your products.
```

**Q3:**
```
Question: Won't it be obvious it's AI?

Answer:
Our videos are created with cinematic quality and realistic fabric physics. Most viewers can't tell the difference from a real shoot.

And remember: this is marketing content, the goal is to showcase your product beautifully and professionally. Just like product photography uses studio lighting and editing for better presentation.
```

**Q4:**
```
Question: Why do I get 5 videos instead of just one?

Answer:
Because we understand that creativity and marketing require options!

With 5 different videos from a single generation, you get:

• Multiple angles and movements: Different ways the model showcases your product
• Testing opportunities: Try different videos on different platforms to see what performs best
• A/B testing: Test which video drives more clicks and sales
• Variety for multi-platform: Use different videos on Etsy, Instagram, TikTok to keep content fresh
• Insurance: If you don't love one, you have 4 more to choose from
• More value: That's just $0.99 per video — incredible value!

Most customers use 2-3 videos from each generation across different listings and platforms. You're not just getting one video — you're getting an entire content library for your product.
```

**Q5:**
```
Question: What if I don't like any of the 5 videos?

Answer:
You have several options:

• Try different settings: Run generation again with different parameters (model, environment, angle) for another $4.99
• Contact support: We're here to help you get the result you want

But in 95% of cases, customers are happy with at least 2-3 videos out of five! That's why we give you 5 options to choose from.
```

**Q6:**
```
Question: How quickly will I get results?

Answer:
Generation takes 3-7 minutes depending on complexity and current system load.

You'll receive an email notification when your videos are ready to download. Results are saved in your account, and you can download them anytime.
```

**Q7:**
```
Question: What video format will I receive?

Answer:
You receive 5 unique videos in vertical 9:16 format, optimized for modern social media and mobile viewing.

• MP4 format, 1080p quality
• Vertical 9:16 orientation
• 5-15 seconds duration

Ready to upload to Etsy, Instagram Stories/Reels, TikTok, Pinterest, Facebook, and any other platform.
```

**Q8:**
```
Question: Can I use one video multiple times?

Answer:
Yes, absolutely! You have full commercial rights to the generated videos.

Use videos:
• On Etsy listings (as many products as you want)
• On Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest
• On your own website
• In paid advertising (Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, etc.)
• In email marketing

Anywhere, as many times as you want, with no additional fees or restrictions.
```

**Q9:**
```
Question: What are the product photo requirements?

Answer:
We work with any photos, but for best results:

• Clean background: White, neutral, or solid color
• Good lighting: Natural or studio lighting
• Details visible: Clear image of the item
• Resolution: Minimum 800x800px (bigger is better)
• Format: JPG, PNG, or HEIC

Even photos on a hanger or flat lay work — our technology adapts!
