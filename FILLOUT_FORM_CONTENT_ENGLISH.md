```

## 🔄 CONVERSION STRATEGIES

### Commitment & Consistency Principle
```
Step 1 (easy) → Step 2 (fun) → Step 3 (creative)
→ Step 4 (trust) → Step 5 (investment)

Each step = micro-commitment
Users who complete 4 steps = high likelihood of payment
```

### Loss Aversion
```
After Step 3:
"You've created your unique video setup!"

On exit attempt:
"Exit now? Your settings will be lost"
```

### Social Proof
```
Step 2: "Sarah from Brooklyn just chose this model"
Step 4: "1,247 videos created today"
Step 5: "Join 1,000+ happy sellers"
```

### Scarcity (ethical)
```
"Launch pricing: $4.99 (regular price $9.99 soon)"
Badge: "Early adopter pricing"
```

### Risk Reversal
```
On Step 5:
"100% money-back guarantee"
"No questions asked refund policy"
"$4.99 = risk-free"
```

---

## 📈 A/B TEST PRIORITIES

```

### Test 2: Number of Models
```
A: 8 models
B: 12 models

Hypothesis: Too much choice can paralyze
```

### Test 3: Guarantee Placement
```
A: Guarantee on Step 5 (Payment)
B: Guarantee on Step 4 (Email)

Hypothesis: Early guarantee increases trust
```

### Test 4: Progress Bar Style
```
A: Percentage bar [████░] 80%
B: Step indicator ● ━ ● ━ ○
C: Numerical "Step 4 of 5"

Hypothesis: Visual progress reduces abandonment
```
